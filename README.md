************************
The premise of this project is based around that of a text based role playing game.
The player's party will navigate through a grid (using a mulidimentional C 
style array e.i. x and y coords) of rooms with atleast 5 unique 
scenarios assigned to each block with a peudo-random number generator.

The player will be able to do the following in each room:
1. Examine the room (Only option available initally)
2. Choose a direction to go (but you must examine the room first, and not be blocked)
3. Fight or engage with an object/puzzle blocking the way to one of the doors.
  If there is something blocking the way you must engage before you can proceed
  through a specific door. During a battle he heap will take values from each objects class
  to determine priority attack sequence.
